# Chrome Extension ToDo

[ ] - Launch instructions on first install. 
[ ] - get pageData for processing
[ ] - use built-in AI features to process data locally
		[ ] - Language API
		[ ] - Summarization API
		[ ] - [Prompt API in Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/ai/prompt-api) 
			[ ] - set up a Prompt API In Extenstions System Prompt
[ ] - allow the user to select what they want to scan
	[ ] - window.selection
	[ ] - dev tools hover and select element.
[ ] - allow user to scan the whole page
		[ ] - will probably need a programmatic catch-all or use Prompt API in Extensions to parse text.


## Future Ideas
